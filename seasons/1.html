  <h3>Recap</h3>
  <p><i>Game note:  Course was holes 1-9.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Flamingo Flyers</strong>: The Flamingo Flyers played their usual strategy of consistent
    and safe play.  Starting off strong with a birdie on hole 1, the Flyers played a fairly unremarkable
    game.  On hole 4 Aurora missed an easy putt due to the muddy conditions, and hole 5 saw a rare tomahawk
    from Orc, perfectly executed to thread the needle of the tree's canopy.  Hole 9 was met with another
    birdie, with Aurora taking both the drive and putt on the shortest hole of the course.  The Flyers
    continue to dominate with their accurate drives, conservative second shots, and easy putt ins.  Today
    they tied St. Anthony's Army for the lead.
  </p>
  <p><strong>St. Anthony's Army</strong>: A near loss by one stroke for St. Anthony's Army, although by
    no means a crippling blow, must weigh heavy on their minds as they still struggle to get it together.
    Vanish drove better than every other team, on hole 1 nearly aceing.  They were the only team to par
    both long holes, 4 and 5, due to Vanish's tee performance.  Saint played well too, embracing the
    newfound strategy of dive shots during approach, but two unfortunate basket bounces on hole 6 and 7
    sealed their fate.  Hole 6 was also the only hole Vanish faltered, hitting a tree just off the tee.
    Now tied, they're looking for a long course to bury the competition.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Misfits</strong>: The Misfits continue their boom or bust cycle, resulting in a thoroughly
    average game.  Slice began the round with a near ace on hole 1, but immediately went back to the
    trees for the rest of the game.  Some of Slice's inaccuracies worked in their favor, like on hole
    3, but other times, Slice was stuck in a tree on hole 6.  The Misfits only had one meltdown, a
    double bogey on the long hole 4, and not enough great holes to make up for it.  Soul Platter
    was boom or bust too, with hole 3 having a great approach, only to suffer and unlucky roll 20 yards
    down a hill.  Hole 6 showed Soul Platter's long range abilities, but hole 9 showed Soul Platter's greatest
    weakness; being so light that sometimes the chains are too heavy to pass.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pioneers</strong>: Clearly, in the several months of down time, the Pioneers were not training
    at all.  Another disastrous performance, with short and erratic drives from Mitch and Aviar doing
    almost nothing of value.  Hole 9 was a perfect opportunity for the weakest team off the tee to get
    some strokes, but instead Mitch went right into the woods for the only penalty stroke of the day,
    getting a truly embarrassing double bogey on the 30 yard hole.  The Pioneers slip even further
    behind at the midpoint of the season, and need to make serious changes to be contenders.

  <h3>Recap</h3>
  <p><i>Game note: Due to strong winds, the penalty stroke rule was waived.  Course was holes 1-7, 17, 18.</i></p>
  <p><strong>St. Anthony's Army</strong>: The Army was able to pull out another 3 points today on
    an extremely windy match.  The steady drives of Vanish and Saint's overstability were the difference
    makers.  Saint is beginning to prove useful to the team less in the putt department and more in the
    second shot.  "Second Shot Saint" should be the new name.  The biggest mishap from Saint was on hole
    five, with a birdie opportunity from a stellar drive from Vanish, that was badly missed.  This would
    have been the difference, but it was made up for on hole 9, with an amazing hyzer put from distance
    in a gusting wind.  Vanish had one humorous drive on 18, which rolled all the way down a big hill
    into a parking lot.  Overall St. Anthony's Army is really coming together as a team, and they add
    to their season point total in a big way today.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Flamingo Flyers</strong>: Orc was an unstoppable force today, despite the wind, having
    the best driving performance of any of the four teams.  Aurora was adequate but not stellar, and
    a strong gust derailed an otherwise normal putt on hole 7, capped off with a pole hit, leading to
    a double bogey.  This was really their only mishap; and came back on hole 8 with a beautiful drive,
    ending in a big skip towards the basket.  They were the only team to par that hole.  On hole 9,
    Orc had two strong drives into the wind, and again, the wind took Aurora off course on the putt.
    This time, from nearly the same place Saint did it, Aurora made a miracle putt to save the hole.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pioneers</strong>: The Pioneers were doomed from the start, but despite being the worst
    equipped team to battle the wind, managed to hang on for a tie for second.  Mitch usually gets
    distance by floating high in the air, stabilizing, and then gracefully floating to the ground.
    This was not an option to day, and in an attempt to keep low drives, Mitch often times overcompensated
    and went right to the dirt.  Aviar played an impressive round, but always ended up on the wrong
    side of success.  Basket bounces, top skips, and pole hits on 5 of the 9 holes.  The statistic
    seems bad, but many were from distance trying to overcome Mitch's poor second shots.  Highlights
    include an easy floating drive on hole five for their first par of the day.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Misfits</strong>: The Misfits are starting to show cracks in their team chemistry
    as the surprising successful start fades to a memory.  Slice actually drove pretty well given
    the circumstances, and Dunham is almost completely tree-less... although on hole 2, Slice did
    manage to get caught in a pine tree.  But they couldn't get their short game under control,
    with Slice taking many of the second shots out of concern for Soul Platter, the lightest in
    the league, not being able to handle the wind.  When given the chance, later in the match,
    Soul Platter did show the ability to adjust and manage the wind, but it was too late.  A
    devastating miss from 5 feet on hole 8 certainly didn't help make the case for Soul Platter.
    As St. Anthony's Army is learning who plays what role to great effect, Misfits seem lost as
    ever in terms of who is best to take what shots.

  <h3>Recap</h3>
  <p><strong>St. Anthony's Army</strong>: St. Anthony's Army went to Johnson Hills, a woods
    course with big elevation changes with a conservative strategy that paid off.  Vanish, without
    the usual opportunity for long drives, carried the team less than usual, even on holes 1 and 2,
    which are the only wide open long holes.  In fact, on 2 Vanish put SAA behind the wall of trees.
    This match really allowed Saint to shine, which was much needed due to recent struggles.  The
    over stability of Saint allowed for big hookshots, skippers, and rollers for the tough second
    shots that Johnson Hills requires.  Shooting bogies on hole 2 and hole 3 (the most difficult
    hole by far), they finished out the game with consistent pars.  Highlights include a huge drive
    on 6 with a near miss on a tough uphill putt, and a big hookshot dive on 5 that saved the par
    for the team.  SAA needed a definitive win to break the tie for first place on the season, and
    they got it today.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Flamingo Flyers</strong>: The Flyers showed improvement on their drive game today, with
    Orc having exceptional drives on hole 6 and hole 8, but also faltering slightly on hole 2, putting
    them behind the wall of trees for a bogey.  This team also struggled on team responsibility, with
    some of the shorter holes, particularly 4, 5, and 9, putting Aurora in the unfamiliar driver
    spot off the tee box.  This game highlighted their inexperience in their roles.  A rare missed
    putt on 9 was a harsh reminder of the importance of consistency.  The team skipped holes 2 and
    3 initially due to slow players.  They were able to finish strong on the tough Hole 3 with a
    great second shot from Orc, weaving through the trees and over the creek.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pioneers</strong>: Out of the basement for the first time, the Pioneers played another
    great game only to be devastated at the last minute.  Mitch proved well equipped for the elevation
    changes and trees largely due to being able to stabilize early and float long distances.  Like FF,
    they skipped holes 2 and 3 due to slow play, and in the mean time, racked up an impressive 2 over
    par, with the lead in view with 2 holes to play.  The only mistake was a missed putt on hole 8.
    Moving back to hole 2, Mitch had a good drive but awful second shot, but Aviar pulled through with
    a 25 yard miracle putt, maintaining par on 2 (the only team to do so).  Going into the final hole
    3 with the lead in view, Mitch threw a beautiful floating drive along the downward countour of the
    hole, landing near the creek, with only the uphill half to go.  An errant second shot sent them
    off course and nearly out of bounds, and then a third shot through a tight window of trees immediately
    hit a tree and bounced backwards.  From this point all hope was lost, and they finished with a
    six for another disappointing finish.  Regardless, they were able to get some points and
    come within striking distance of the Misfits.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Misfits</strong>: At this point, a tree course is a death knell for the Misfits after
    placing third at Winton Woods and last today.  The misfits started off strong, with beautiful long
    drives from Slice on the open holes 1 and 2.  Soul Platter missed a second shot and a putt on 2,
    but a bogey was not uncommon today.  Then hole 3 came and everything went down hill.  Slice was
    a tree magnet, hitting 4 trees on the first 3 shots.  Progress was so short they had to settle
    for a double bogey.  From there on out they played decently, including a spectacular drive from
    Slice on the narrow hole 6, but still with tree woes.  Hole 7 brought such a bad drive the second
    shot had to go backwards to continue the hole and stay in bounds, but was salvaged by a long low
    put from Soul Platter.  Then came hole 8.  The fairly easy hole started with Slice going wide left
    into the woods for a penalty stroke.  The play out stroke hit a tree and went about 5 feet.  By
    the time they were back on course, they were shooting for 5, and eventually got a triple bogey.
    This was the difference between last place and 0 points and second place with 2 points.  Again
    the Misfits show their inconsistency, aggressive play, and affinity for trees and penalty shots
    is what dooms them, not overall ability.

  <h3>Recap</h3>
  <p><strong>Flamingo Flyers</strong>: Coming in first this match was the Flamingo Flyers, with
    excellent short game play from Aurora.  Orc still is working out the kinks of the drive,
    but on a shorter course like Winton Woods, it was less of a factor.  The only team today
    to not score a bogey, there were no stand out great shots, but no stand out bad shots either,
    which so far is the difference maker in this league.  Aurora didn't miss a single putt, which
    although not flashy, is a commendable accomplishment.
  </p>
  <p><strong>St. Anthony's Army</strong>: St. Anthony's Army played well again today, but the
    struggles continue for Saint, who easily missed enough strokes to keep them out of first
    place.  Vanish continues to shine in the driving, easily the most consistent of any of the
    four teams.  Hole four, in particular, was a particularly heinous miss, a devastating loss
    of a stroke on an otherwise easy hole.  Fans are starting to question Saint's position on the
    team, who isn't known for putting but filled the role out of necessity.  One has to wonder
    how Vanish, excelling in the league, is feeling about Saint's ineptitude.  Although their
    score today brings them into a first place tie in the overall league score, many believe that
    if paired with Aurora or Soul Platter they would be unstoppable.  One particularly bad
    hole was Hole 2, a 40 foot birdie machine, where slice missed an easy putt.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Misfits</strong>: Watching the Misfits is a roller coaster of emotions.  They've seen
    success in the league so far, but make it extremely difficult on themselves.  Starting off the
    game, both Slice and Soul Platter were way high in the trees, posting a bogey on an otherwise
    easy hole.  They followed that with a birdie, and a slew of pars behind solid drives by Slice.
    On hole 7, Slice clipped a tree and went straight to the ground, which was bad enough, but then
    Soul Platter missed an easy putt off of a good second recovery shot.  Finally, in hole 9, slice
    drove within 5 feet of the hole for an easy birdie.  They were the only team to get two birdies
    and two bogeys.  Unfortunately, their third place showing this match knocks them off the top
    spot they held for a brief time.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pioneers</strong>: The struggles continue for the Pioneers, who other than a truly
    lousy hole 7, played a solid game that should have left them at -1 and tied for second.  Posting
    a triple bogey on hole 7 sealed their fate, a sad end to an otherwise solid performance.  Off
    of the tee box, Mitch attempted a Thumber, a tough shot they were inexperienced with.  Although
    starting off with high hopes, the shot glanced a tree and sent the disc into the woods.  This
    was the first instance of the new out of bounds rule, which caused a penalty stroke.  Then,
    attempting a roller (another rarely utilized shot), Mitch went to the other side of the course,
    nearly out of bounds again.  For the fourth shot, Mitch got close to the basket, but Aviar, in
    the worst possible timing, missed a putt.  Another example of a team playing well except for a
    one hole meltdown.

  <h3>Recap</h3>
  <p><i>Game note: Matches started on hole 5.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Misfits</strong>: Coming out on top of match 2 was the Misfits, who played the most
    consistent game of all the teams today.  Starting on hole five, Slice immediately went into
    a tree to start off with a bogey, as Soul Platter struggled in the wind.  Following another
    bogey on the uphill and deceptively tough hole 6, the Misfits then played par golf, with
    the exception of hole 2, the longest and most difficult hole.  Slice was exceptionally good
    off the tee box, with an exceptional drive on 9 landing less than 10 yards from the hole.  Soul
    Platter couldn't finish though, missing an opportunity to take an even bigger lead.  Slice
    took on most of the second shot duties today and did well in that role too.
  </p>
  <p><strong>St. Anthony's Army</strong>: St. Anthony's Army struggled in the first third of the
    course, marked by several basket bouncers from Saint.  Things began to turn around with a
    superb drive from Vanish on hole 8.  A beautiful S curve shot, starting right before a
    hard hook left (to avoid a tree) and a gentle glide left again (between the two large bushes
    flanking the basket) led to a near ace, landing within 3 yards of the basket.  They played good
    golf from there on out, but the early faltering made it impossible for them to come back despite
    overall good play.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Flamingo Flyers</strong>: The Flamingo Flyers, in their season debut, played consistent
    and conservative disc golf.  Starting off with a slew of pars, their game was marked by
    underwhelming, but not disastrous, drives from Orc and very good second shots and puts from
    Aurora.  A horrendous showing on the infamous hole 2, the longest and most difficult hole of
    the course, left them with a triple bogey and the majority of their strokes.  Even a mediocre
    showing on this hole would have left them a clear winner, so a simultaneously disappointing but
    encouraging debut.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pioneers</strong>: Coming off last match with a lot of work to do, the Pioneers secured
    their tie for second place and a spot on the scoreboard.  Whereas last match their score didn't
    reflect how poorly they played, this match, it didn't reflect how well they played.  Starting off
    the game with a double bogey due to tree drives and basket bouncers, they were able to rally back
    for perhaps the shot of the day; a 20 yard approach shot by Aviar from a solid drive from Mitch.
    Unfortunately, a basket bouncer gained them a bogey on the short hole 8.  The Pioneers were the
    only team to earn a 4 on hole 2, so they should be going into the next match with some confidence.

  <h3>Recap</h3>
  <p><i>Game note: Matches started on hole 3.</i></p>
  <p><strong>St. Anthony's Army</strong>: In a shocker to start the season, St. Anthony's Army pulled
    out the surprise victory in the season opener.  Vanish  was able to squash the competition with
    consistent and accurate drives, while Saint, in its new role as a putter, provided serviceable
    short game, using its weight against the wind.  A missed put on the tough hole 4, and a drive
    into a tree on hole 8 were the only obstacles in an otherwise par day.  It remains to be seen
    how this team will perform in higher stakes scenarios on more difficult courses.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Frequent Flyers</strong>: Tying for second place, the Frequent Flyers put on a
    disappointing showing for being the league favorites.  Overall, Boss had powerful and accurate
    drives, but Shark couldn't seem to seal the deal for the birdie.  A disastrous hole 1 sealed
    their fate, due to a treed drive and a dismal second shot from Shark.  Shark did, however, prove
    useful, teeing off on holes 8 and 9 with well placed drives, and finishing up with the approach
    and putt.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Misfits</strong>: Another surprise today coming from Misfits, delivering a commendable
    performance and a tie for second against the league favorite.  Kicked off with surprisingly
    strong drives for Slice, they quickly degraded into tree magnets.  Things went further downhill
    when an approach shot from Soul Platter went way off course, sealing the deal on a bogie.  This
    rattled the team into hole 7, and Slice took over many of the approach duties afterwards.
    Soul Platter was able to partially redeem itself with a great approach shot on 1, which gave
    there teams fits.  Misfits were the only team to record par on hole 4, one of the most
    difficult holes at Embshoff, besides 1.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pioneers</strong>: Truly disastrous day from the Pioneers to which the score doesn't
    reflect.  The Pioneers consider themselves lucky to be only 1 stroke behind the pack, as Mitch's
    drives went into other fairways, the woods, or 30ft ahead of the tee.  Aviar didn't make a
    single shot it needed to make, and if it wasn't for some heroic approach shots from Mitch, this
    team would have been truly sunk.  Pioneers will need a lot of practice if they intend to
    compete on longer, more difficult courses.
