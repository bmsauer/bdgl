  <h3>Recap</h3>
  <p><strong>Flamingo Flyers</strong>: Coming in first this match was the Flamingo Flyers, with
    excellent short game play from Aurora.  Orc still is working out the kinks of the drive,
    but on a shorter course like Winton Woods, it was less of a factor.  The only team today
    to not score a bogey, there were no stand out great shots, but no stand out bad shots either,
    which so far is the difference maker in this league.  Aurora didn't miss a single putt, which
    although not flashy, is a commendable accomplishment.
  </p>
  <p><strong>St. Anthony's Army</strong>: St. Anthony's Army played well again today, but the
    struggles continue for Saint, who easily missed enough strokes to keep them out of first
    place.  Vanish continues to shine in the driving, easily the most consistent of any of the
    four teams.  Hole four, in particular, was a particularly heinous miss, a devastating loss
    of a stroke on an otherwise easy hole.  Fans are starting to question Saint's position on the
    team, who isn't known for putting but filled the role out of necessity.  One has to wonder
    how Vanish, excelling in the league, is feeling about Saint's ineptitude.  Although their
    score today brings them into a first place tie in the overall league score, many believe that
    if paired with Aurora or Soul Platter they would be unstoppable.  One particularly bad
    hole was Hole 2, a 40 foot birdie machine, where slice missed an easy putt.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Misfits</strong>: Watching the Misfits is a roller coaster of emotions.  They've seen
    success in the league so far, but make it extremely difficult on themselves.  Starting off the
    game, both Slice and Soul Platter were way high in the trees, posting a bogey on an otherwise
    easy hole.  They followed that with a birdie, and a slew of pars behind solid drives by Slice.
    On hole 7, Slice clipped a tree and went straight to the ground, which was bad enough, but then
    Soul Platter missed an easy putt off of a good second recovery shot.  Finally, in hole 9, slice
    drove within 5 feet of the hole for an easy birdie.  They were the only team to get two birdies
    and two bogeys.  Unfortunately, their third place showing this match knocks them off the top
    spot they held for a brief time.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pioneers</strong>: The struggles continue for the Pioneers, who other than a truly
    lousy hole 7, played a solid game that should have left them at -1 and tied for second.  Posting
    a triple bogey on hole 7 sealed their fate, a sad end to an otherwise solid performance.  Off
    of the tee box, Mitch attempted a Thumber, a tough shot they were inexperienced with.  Although
    starting off with high hopes, the shot glanced a tree and sent the disc into the woods.  This
    was the first instance of the new out of bounds rule, which caused a penalty stroke.  Then,
    attempting a roller (another rarely utilized shot), Mitch went to the other side of the course,
    nearly out of bounds again.  For the fourth shot, Mitch got close to the basket, but Aviar, in
    the worst possible timing, missed a putt.  Another example of a team playing well except for a
    one hole meltdown.

  <h3>Recap</h3>
  <p><i>Game note: Matches started on hole 5.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Misfits</strong>: Coming out on top of match 2 was the Misfits, who played the most
    consistent game of all the teams today.  Starting on hole five, Slice immediately went into
    a tree to start off with a bogey, as Soul Platter struggled in the wind.  Following another
    bogey on the uphill and deceptively tough hole 6, the Misfits then played par golf, with
    the exception of hole 2, the longest and most difficult hole.  Slice was exceptionally good
    off the tee box, with an exceptional drive on 9 landing less than 10 yards from the hole.  Soul
    Platter couldn't finish though, missing an opportunity to take an even bigger lead.  Slice
    took on most of the second shot duties today and did well in that role too.
  </p>
  <p><strong>St. Anthony's Army</strong>: St. Anthony's Army struggled in the first third of the
    course, marked by several basket bouncers from Saint.  Things began to turn around with a
    superb drive from Vanish on hole 8.  A beautiful S curve shot, starting right before a
    hard hook left (to avoid a tree) and a gentle glide left again (between the two large bushes
    flanking the basket) led to a near ace, landing within 3 yards of the basket.  They played good
    golf from there on out, but the early faltering made it impossible for them to come back despite
    overall good play.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Flamingo Flyers</strong>: The Flamingo Flyers, in their season debut, played consistent
    and conservative disc golf.  Starting off with a slew of pars, their game was marked by
    underwhelming, but not disastrous, drives from Orc and very good second shots and puts from
    Aurora.  A horrendous showing on the infamous hole 2, the longest and most difficult hole of
    the course, left them with a triple bogey and the majority of their strokes.  Even a mediocre
    showing on this hole would have left them a clear winner, so a simultaneously disappointing but
    encouraging debut.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pioneers</strong>: Coming off last match with a lot of work to do, the Pioneers secured
    their tie for second place and a spot on the scoreboard.  Whereas last match their score didn't
    reflect how poorly they played, this match, it didn't reflect how well they played.  Starting off
    the game with a double bogey due to tree drives and basket bouncers, they were able to rally back
    for perhaps the shot of the day; a 20 yard approach shot by Aviar from a solid drive from Mitch.
    Unfortunately, a basket bouncer gained them a bogey on the short hole 8.  The Pioneers were the
    only team to earn a 4 on hole 2, so they should be going into the next match with some confidence.

  <h3>Recap</h3>
  <p><i>Game note: Matches started on hole 3.</i></p>
  <p><strong>St. Anthony's Army</strong>: In a shocker to start the season, St. Anthony's Army pulled
    out the surprise victory in the season opener.  Vanish  was able to squash the competition with
    consistent and accurate drives, while Saint, in its new role as a putter, provided serviceable
    short game, using its weight against the wind.  A missed put on the tough hole 4, and a drive
    into a tree on hole 8 were the only obstacles in an otherwise par day.  It remains to be seen
    how this team will perform in higher stakes scenarios on more difficult courses.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Frequent Flyers</strong>: Tying for second place, the Frequent Flyers put on a
    disappointing showing for being the league favorites.  Overall, Boss had powerful and accurate
    drives, but Shark couldn't seem to seal the deal for the birdie.  A disastrous hole 1 sealed
    their fate, due to a treed drive and a dismal second shot from Shark.  Shark did, however, prove
    useful, teeing off on holes 8 and 9 with well placed drives, and finishing up with the approach
    and putt.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Misfits</strong>: Another surprise today coming from Misfits, delivering a commendable
    performance and a tie for second against the league favorite.  Kicked off with surprisingly
    strong drives for Slice, they quickly degraded into tree magnets.  Things went further downhill
    when an approach shot from Soul Platter went way off course, sealing the deal on a bogie.  This
    rattled the team into hole 7, and Slice took over many of the approach duties afterwards.
    Soul Platter was able to partially redeem itself with a great approach shot on 1, which gave
    there teams fits.  Misfits were the only team to record par on hole 4, one of the most
    difficult holes at Embshoff, besides 1.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pioneers</strong>: Truly disastrous day from the Pioneers to which the score doesn't
    reflect.  The Pioneers consider themselves lucky to be only 1 stroke behind the pack, as Mitch's
    drives went into other fairways, the woods, or 30ft ahead of the tee.  Aviar didn't make a
    single shot it needed to make, and if it wasn't for some heroic approach shots from Mitch, this
    team would have been truly sunk.  Pioneers will need a lot of practice if they intend to
    compete on longer, more difficult courses.
