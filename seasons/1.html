  <h3>Recap</h3>
  <p><i>Game note: Matches started on hole 3.</i></p>
  <p><strong>St. Anthony's Army</strong>: In a shocker to start the season, St. Anthony's Army pulled
    out the surprise victory in the season opener.  Vanish  was able to squash the competition with
    consistent and accurate drives, while Saint, in its new role as a putter, provided serviceable
    short game, using its weight against the wind.  A missed put on the tough hole 4, and a drive
    into a tree on hole 8 were the only obstacles in an otherwise par day.  It remains to be seen
    how this team will perform in higher stakes scenarios on more difficult courses.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Frequent Flyers</strong>: Tying for second place, the Frequent Flyers put on a
    disappointing showing for being the league favorites.  Overall, Boss had powerful and accurate
    drives, but Shark couldn't seem to seal the deal for the birdie.  A disasterous hole 1 sealed
    their fate, due to a treed drive and a dismal second shot from Shark.  Shark did, however, prove
    useful, teeing off on holes 8 and 9 with well placed drives, and finishing up with the approach
    and putt.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Misfits</strong>: Another surprise today coming from Misfits, delivering a commendable
    performance and a tie for second against the league favorite.  Kicked off with surprisingly
    strong drives for Slice, they quickly degraded into tree magnets.  Things went further downhill
    when an approach shot from Soul Platter went way off course, sealing the deal on a bogie.  This
    rattled the team into hole 7, and Slice took over many of the approach duties afterwards.
    Soul Platter was able to partially redeem itself with a great approach shot on 1, which gave
    ther teams fits.  Misfits were the only team to record par on hole 4, one of the most
    difficult holes at Embshoff, besides 1.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pioneers</strong>: Truly disasterous day from the Pioneers to which the score doesn't
    reflect.  The Pioneers consider themselves lucky to be only 1 stroke behind the pack, as Mitch's
    drives went into other fairways, the woods, or 30ft ahead of the tee.  Aviar didn't make a
    single shot it needed to make, and if it wasn't for some heroic approach shots from Mitch, this
    team would have been truly sunk.  Pioneers will need a lot of practice if they intend to
    compete on longer, more difficult courses.
