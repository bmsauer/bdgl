  <h2>Teams</h2>
  <h3>Frequent Flyers</h3>
  <img class="team" src="img/frequentflyers.jpg" />
  <p><i>Driver: Innova Pro Boss.  Putter: Innova Shark</i></p>
  <p>The Frequent Flyers consist of two of the more recognizable discs in the BDGL, and are the
    heavy favorites for the Blue Boss Memorial Disk.  In fact, Boss is a direct
    descendant of the disk for which our championship is named.  While Boss handles the driving
    duties, the versatile Shark holds down the putting, approach, and escape shots.  A
    relative newcomer to the team, Shark replaced Mitch in a trade with the
    Pioneers.

  <h3>Misfits</h3>
  <img class="team" src="img/misfits.jpg" />
  <p><i>Driver: Lightning Slice.  Putter: Little Flyer "Soul Platter" Optimizer.</i></p>
  <p>Truly an oddball team, Slice and Soul Platter are an unpredictable duo capable of the
    highest highs and the lowest lows.  Slice's extreme understability and Soul Platter's
    extreme... erraticness... mean they play the holes unlike any other team in the circuit.
    Underdogs till the end, the Misfits are dead set on proving that bargain brand discs can
    win this competitive league.

  <h3>St. Anthony's Army</h3>
  <img class="team" src="img/stanthonysarmy.jpg" />
  <p><i>Driver: Axiom Vanish. Putter: Latitude 64 Saint.</i></p>
  <p>Named after the patron saint of lost things, Vanish and Saint are both discs rescued from
    the woods and often times find themselves lost again.  Their strange colors are not the only
    unique thing about this team; they are the only team to feature both overstable disks, and also
    have a driver handling the putting duties.  If they can make in through the season without
    wandering into the woods, they could be a contender for the championship.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Pioneers</h3>
  <img class="team" src="img/pioneers.jpg" />
  <p><i>Driver: Innova "Mitch" Leopard.  Putter: Innova Aviar.</i></p>
  <p>The Pioneers represent the everyman in this tournament; slow and steady, tried and true.
    What they lack in flash they hope to make up for in consistency, with the easy going Mitch
    off the tee and second shot, then Aviar handling the tough putts.  Mitch is the only primarily
    backhand driver in the league, and with the inexperienced Aviar, they certainly have an upward
    battle in this competitive league.
