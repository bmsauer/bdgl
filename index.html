  <h4>Statement on the loss of Boss and Shark</h4>
  <p>It is with great sadness that the league announces the loss of both Shark and Boss, legendary
    golfers who, in separate, non-league games, were lost to the Wilderness in August.</p>
  <p>On August 10th at Burnet Woods, Shark was executing a routine approach shot on hole two when
    a fluke error sent Shark flying into the Wilderness.  No one heard Shark land, and after a long
    search, Shark was declared lost.</p>
  <p>On exiting the Wilderness after the search, a disc was recovered from the Wilderness, another
    Innova Shark, which we now know as Shark Jr.  Theologians and conspiracy theorists alike are
    still debating the significance of this event.
  <p>Later in the week, Boss, obviously distressed from the loss of Shark, on another routine throw,
    went low and shallow into the tall grass on hole 16 at Heritage Park..  Although seemingly an
    easy recovery, Boss' yellow color sealed their fate, and after a long search, Boss was declared
    as Lost.</p>
  <p>Boss and Shark were the foundational team of the BDGL and the most experienced veterans.
    Because of their tragic and losses, the BDGL has implemented a new rule to encourage less
    aggressive play: any disc flying more than 6 feet into an out of bounds area will be issued a
    penalty stroke and have to play from where it lies.</p>
  <p>In this time of grieving and reflection, we hope to honor the lives of our friends by continuing
    play.  In this spirit, a new team, the Flamingo Flyers, have been called up from the minors to
    take their place.</p>
